## 6)The design utilizes an NMOS transistor with the following parameters:
- Technology: 180nm CMOS (via tsmc018.txt).
- Calculate Drain Current Using Power Constraint
Using:

  P = V × I
- 0.5 × 10⁻³ = 2 × ID
- ID = (0.5 × 10⁻³) / 2
- ID ≈ 3.33 × 10⁻⁴ A
- ID ≈ 0.3 mA
- let me consider Id = 0.2mA so we will get the power (p = I x V ) = 0.2m x 1.5 = o.3mW
- therefore the power is greater than the given power
  
- Drain Resistor ($R_D$): $3.75\text{ k}\Omega$.
- Supply Voltage ($V_{DD}$): $1.5\text{V}$.
- Gate Bias ($V_G$): $0.9\text{V}$.
- Vt : ($V_{Vt}$): $0.36\text{V}$.
- Device Dimensions: $L = 180\text{nm}$,
- $W$ is tuned to achieve the target current.

-  - (1.5-0.75)/200uA= ($R_D$): $3.75\text{ k}\Omega$.
   # Fix Q-Point
- For maximum symmetrical swing:
  - VDS = VDD / 2
  - VDS = 1.5 / 2
  - VDS = 0.75 V   
- 
  # Calculate Drain Resistor(RD)
  -  - RD=(VDD-VD0/ID
     - =(1.5-0.75)/200×10^(-6)
       - RD=3.75k
         
   -  VGS>Vt
   - VDS>VGS-Vt
   - Saturation Region
   - ID= 1/2×μCOX×W/L×(VGS-Vt)²
   - W=(2.ID.L)/(μCOX×((VGS-Vt)²).
     
  -  C)W=μCox​(VGS-Vt)²/2.ID.​L
  -  
  -  # Given Parameters(From tsmc018.lib)
  -   μ=273.89×10^(-4)
 
    # Calculate COX
  -   εox=𝜀𝑟ε0​.
  -   𝜀𝑟=3.9.  ε0​=8.854×10^(-12)
  -   Eox=𝜀𝑟ε0​=34.53×10^(-12)

  -   tox=4.1×10^(-9)
  # Calculate Process Transconductance Parameter(Kn')

   -  μn=273.80cm²/V.s
 
   -  Now
  - kn'=μn×Cox
  
  -   μnCOX=Eox/tox=230.5×10^(-6)
  -   L=180nm
  -   ​
  -   W=(2×200u×180n)/(230.5u×(0.9-0.36)=1.07u
  -   W=1.07u we get ID=147uA then
  -   ID=200uA. our required then we increase W=1.58u and we get Same ID.
    
## 7)	Theory And Simulation Setup
#### DC Analysis :
In DC analysis the goal is to establish the stable operationg point for the MOSFET, ensuring it remains in the saturation region for proper amplification.The MOSFET operates in the saturation region when drain-source voltage(VDS) is greater than the overdrive voltage (VOV=VGS-VTH). the drain current is given by
ID= 1/2Kn(VOV)2
VDS and ID provides the operating point of the MOSFET.

#### Transient analysis :
Transient analysis examines how the amplifier responds to time varying signals, such as pulse inputs or sudden changes in voltage. The behaviour is influenced by the charging and discharging of capacitors including coupling capacitors and bypass capacitors.The response of the amplifier due to the sudden changes in the input is limited by its time constants which depends upon the capacitance and resistance in the circuit. Transient analysis is crucial in high speed applications where rise time, fall time, propagation delay determines the amplifier's suitability for fast signals.

##### Fig 3: Transient Analysis Parameters 

#### AC analysis:
In AC analysis MOSFET treated as a linear small-signal amplifier, where the drain current is proportional to small variations in gate volatge
iD=gmvgs
where gm is transconductance. Therefore, The voltage gain of the amplifier is given by
Av= -gm(RD||RL)
The negative sign indicates the 180 degree phase shift between the input and output signals. The input impedance is primarily determined by the gate biasing resitors whereas output impedance is largely influenced by the resistor RD . At low frequency the gain is effected by coupling capacitors and bypass capacitors, while at high frequencies by paracitic capacitors.

##### Fig 6: AC Ananlysis Result

- At Frequency =  54.77GHz
- Gain = 7.19-3=4.19 dB
-BW= 8.84×54.77Ghz=484.16Ghz
- 

  
- Av = −gm RD

- gm = (2 × 200µA) / (0.9 − 0.36)
- gm = 0.74 mS
- Av = 0.74 × 10⁻³ × 3.75 × 10³
- Av = 2.77
- Gain in dB:
- 20 log(2.77) = 8.849 dB
  
- # practical
- Av=Vout/Vin
-Av= 43.89m/19.14m=2.289.
- 20log(2.289)=7.19 dB

This gives a higher value because it assumes ideal MOSFET.

Midband gain ≈ 2.300 nearly
Gain in dB ≈ 7.234dB
2.300 dB bandwidth ≈ 4.792 MHz
GBP ≈ 8.849 × 4.792 MHz ≈ 42.40MHz (approx) From the AC frequency response analysis of the MOSFET common-source amplifier, it is observed that the amplifier provides a constant gain in the midband region, indicating stable amplification for low and medium frequencies

##### Fig 7: Transient Analysis Result

- A common source amplifier typically provides a 180° phase shift between input (Vin) and output (Vout) at mid-frequency.
- From the ploted graph, the phase shift at-- (marked on the graph) is approximately
---
- This phase shift deviates from ideal 180° due to the influence of parasitic capacitances, load resistance, and MOSFET characteristics.
- Vout= 0.745V for width of 1.07um this is practical but we change to set 200uA W=1.58u

  ## Inference
 - From the DC analysis, we determine the DC operating point of the MOSFET, which helps verify whether the transistor is functioning in the saturation region. This confirmation is crucial, as operation in saturation ensures that the MOSFET acts as an amplifier with the desired characteristics. 

 - AC Analysis: The circuit maintains a stable gain over different frequencies, proving it works well for amplification. The voltage gain is 3 (or 7.19 dB), and the -3 dB point (where gain drops) confirms its frequency limits. Simulation and theoretical results are in close agreement, with minor variations due to parasitic effects.
